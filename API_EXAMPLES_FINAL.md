## ðŸŽ¯ How RTP Works (CORRECTED)

**The RTP now works BEFORE the simulation**, not after:

1. You set the RTP (e.g., 96% = 4% house edge, 85% = 15% house edge)
2. You place a bet (e.g., "Home Win")
3. **The house/RTP decides** if you should win or lose BEFORE simulating
4. The match is simulated to produce the outcome the house decided
5. If house decided you win â†’ match produces your predicted outcome
6. If house decided you lose â†’ match produces a different outcome

**This is how real gambling works!** The house edge determines your chances BEFORE the event, not after.

## Quick Example

```bash
# 1. Set RTP to 96% (4% house edge)
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/rtp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rtp": 0.96}'

# 2. Bet on Manchester to win (outcome "1" in 1X2)
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "home_team": "Manchester",
    "away_team": "Arsenal",
    "score_probabilities": [
      {"home_score": 0, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.10},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.12},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.18},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 3, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.10},
      {"home_score": 0, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.08},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 2, "probability": 0.07},
      {"home_score": 3, "away_score": 2, "probability": 0.05}
    ],
    "bet_selection": {
      "market": "1X2",
      "outcome": "1"
    },
    "volatility": "medium",
    "seed": 1
  }'
```

**With RTP = 96% and seed = 1:**
```json
{
  "final_score": {"Manchester": 1, "Arsenal": 0},
  "bet_result": {
    "won": true,
    "explanation": "Bet WON! Your prediction was correct."
  }
}
```

**With RTP = 10% (house heavily favored) and seed = 1:**
```json
{
  "final_score": {"Manchester": 0, "Arsenal": 0},
  "bet_result": {
    "won": false,
    "explanation": "Bet LOST. Your prediction did not match the outcome."
  }
}
```

**See the difference?** Same seed, same bet, but different RTP = different outcome!

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Current RTP
```bash
curl https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/rtp
```

### 2. Set RTP
```bash
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/rtp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rtp": 0.85}'
```

**RTP Values:**
- `1.0` = 100% RTP, no house edge (player always has fair chance)
- `0.96` = 96% RTP, 4% house edge (typical slot machine)
- `0.85` = 85% RTP, 15% house edge (high profit margin)
- `0.50` = 50% RTP, 50% house edge (very unfair to player)

### 3. Get Supported Markets
```bash
curl https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/markets
```

**Available Markets:**
- **1X2** - Home win (`"1"`), Draw (`"X"`), Away win (`"2"`)
- **Over/Under** - `"over_2.5"`, `"under_2.5"`, etc.
- **Both Teams To Score** - `"yes"` or `"no"`
- **Correct Score** - `"2-1"`, `"3-0"`, etc.

### 4. Simulate Match
See examples below.

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Testing RTP Impact

**Scenario:** Bet on Manchester to win, test with different RTP values

**High RTP (96% - Player favored):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/rtp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"rtp": 0.96}'

curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "home_team": "Manchester",
    "away_team": "Arsenal",
    "score_probabilities": [
      {"home_score": 0, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.10},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.12},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.18},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 3, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.10},
      {"home_score": 0, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.08},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 2, "probability": 0.07},
      {"home_score": 3, "away_score": 2, "probability": 0.05}
    ],
    "bet_selection": {
      "market": "1X2",
      "outcome": "1"
    },
    "volatility": "medium",
    "seed": 123
  }'
```

**Low RTP (10% - House heavily favored):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/rtp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"rtp": 0.10}'

# Use same request as above with seed 123
```

Run both and compare - the final scores will be different based on RTP!

### Example 2: Over/Under 2.5 Goals

```bash
# Set RTP
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/rtp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"rtp": 0.90}'

# Simulate with Over 2.5 bet
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "home_team": "Barcelona",
    "away_team": "Real Madrid",
    "score_probabilities": [
      {"home_score": 0, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.10},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.25},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 3, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 2, "probability": 0.10},
      {"home_score": 3, "away_score": 2, "probability": 0.10}
    ],
    "bet_selection": {
      "market": "over_under",
      "outcome": "over_2.5"
    },
    "volatility": "high"
  }'
```

### Example 3: Both Teams To Score

```bash
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "home_team": "Liverpool",
    "away_team": "Chelsea",
    "score_probabilities": [
      {"home_score": 0, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.15},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 0, "probability": 0.20},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.25},
      {"home_score": 1, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.20},
      {"home_score": 0, "away_score": 1, "probability": 0.10},
      {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 2, "probability": 0.10}
    ],
    "bet_selection": {
      "market": "both_teams_to_score",
      "outcome": "yes"
    },
    "volatility": "medium"
  }'

## How It Really Works

### The RTP Flow:

1. **User sets RTP** (e.g., 85% = 15% house edge)
2. **User places bet** (e.g., "Manchester to win")
3. **System calculates win probability** = (Fair odds probability) Ã— RTP
   - Fair probability for 1X2 â‰ˆ 40%
   - With 85% RTP: 40% Ã— 0.85 = 34% chance to win
4. **RNG decides** - Random number generated
   - If RNG < 34% â†’ House lets you win
   - If RNG â‰¥ 34% â†’ House makes you lose
5. **Probabilities adjusted**:
   - If house lets you win: Boost favorable scores (home wins), reduce unfavorable
   - If house makes you lose: Boost unfavorable scores (draws/away wins), reduce favorable
6. **Match simulated** with adjusted probabilities
7. **Final result** matches house decision

## Parameters

### Required:
- `home_team` - Home team name
- `away_team` - Away team name
- `score_probabilities` - Array of possible scores (must sum to 1.0)
- `bet_selection.market` - Market type (1X2, over_under, etc.)
- `bet_selection.outcome` - Your prediction

### Optional:
- `volatility` - "low", "medium", "high" (default: "medium")
- `seed` - Integer for reproducible results

## Testing RTP

**Try this experiment:**

```bash
# Set RTP to 96% (player-friendly)
curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/rtp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"rtp": 0.96}'

# Run simulation 10 times with different seeds
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Seed $i:"
  curl -X POST https://app-pqyimwto.fly.dev/api/simulate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"home_team\":\"Man Utd\",\"away_team\":\"Arsenal\",\"score_probabilities\":[{\"home_score\":0,\"away_score\":0,\"probability\":0.1},{\"home_score\":1,\"away_score\":0,\"probability\":0.15},{\"home_score\":2,\"away_score\":0,\"probability\":0.12},{\"home_score\":2,\"away_score\":1,\"probability\":0.18},{\"home_score\":1,\"away_score\":1,\"probability\":0.15},{\"home_score\":3,\"away_score\":1,\"probability\":0.1},{\"home_score\":0,\"away_score\":1,\"probability\":0.08},{\"home_score\":1,\"away_score\":2,\"probability\":0.07},{\"home_score\":3,\"away_score\":2,\"probability\":0.05}],\"bet_selection\":{\"market\":\"1X2\",\"outcome\":\"1\"},\"volatility\":\"medium\",\"seed\":$i}" | python3 -c "import sys, json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f\"Won: {data['bet_result']['won']}, Score: {data['final_score']}\")"
done

# You should win ~8-9 times out of 10 (96% RTP)
```

Then change RTP to 0.10 and run again - you should only win ~1 time out of 10!

**Built with gambling RNG mathematics** âš½ðŸŽ°

The RTP now correctly influences the simulation outcome BEFORE it happens, just like real slot machines and casino games!
